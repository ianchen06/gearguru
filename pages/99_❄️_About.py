    ## History

    - Founded in 2007 by professional snowboarder Jeremy Jones.
    - Grew out of the realization that climate change was directly impacting the snowpack and winter sports Jones and others relied on.
    - Has expanded into a global network with country-specific chapters (US, Canada, UK, France, etc.).

    ## Mission
